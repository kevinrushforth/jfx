### JavaFX 24 Requires JDK 22 or Later

JavaFX 24 is compiled with `--release 22` and thus requires JDK 22 or later in order to run. If you attempt to run with an older JDK, the Java launcher will exit with an error message indicating that the `javafx.base` module cannot be read.

See [JDK-8340003](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8340003) for more information.
