### Pluggable Image Loading via javax.imageio

JavaFX 24 supports the Java Image I/O API, allowing applications to use third-party image loaders in addition to the built-in image loaders. This includes the ability to use variable-density image loaders for formats like SVG. When an image is loaded using a variable-density image loader, JavaFX rasterizes the image with the screen's DPI scaling.

Applications that want to use this feature can use existing open-source Image I/O extension libraries, or register a custom Image I/O service provider instance with the IIORegistry class. Refer to the Java Image I/O documentation for more information.

See [JDK-8306707](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8306707) for more information.
