### JavaFX No Longer Supports Running With a Security Manager

The Java Security Manager has been permanently disabled in JDK 24 via [JEP 486](https://openjdk.org/jeps/486).

Likewise, as of JavaFX 24, it is no longer possible to run JavaFX applications with a security manager enabled. This is true even if you run your application on an older JDK that still supports the security manager.

The following exception will be thrown when the JavaFX runtime is initialized if the Security Manager is enabled:

```
UnsupportedOperationException: JavaFX does not support running with the Security Manager
```

See [JDK-8341090](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8341090) for more information.
