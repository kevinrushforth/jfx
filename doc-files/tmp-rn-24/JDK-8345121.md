### JavaFX Warning Printed for Use of Terminally Deprecated Methods in sun.misc.Unsafe

Running a JavaFX application on JDK 24 will produce a warning the first time any UI Control or complex shape is rendered:

```
WARNING: A terminally deprecated method in sun.misc.Unsafe has been called
...
WARNING: sun.misc.Unsafe::allocateMemory will be removed in a future release
```

To disable this warning, pass `--sun-misc-unsafe-memory-access=allow` to `java` on the command line. For example:

```
java --sun-misc-unsafe-memory-access=allow
```

This will be fixed in a subsequent version of JavaFX, after which time this flag will no longer be needed.

See [JDK-8345121](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8345121) for more information.
